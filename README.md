# Rocket-Mass-Calculator
This program determines the most optimal rocket design to use based on the destination as well as the number of stages required,
which are inputted by the user. The program outputs the mass distribution needed for each stage for the payload to arrive at the
destination by maximizing the payload fraction, or the ratio between the payload mass and the total rocket mass. The optimal rocket
is defined by the minimal mass required to arrive at the destination while optimizing the mass distribution between the stages.
